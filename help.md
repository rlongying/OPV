## About Zenwallet
Zenwallet provides cardholder support for most prepaid cards purchased at Canada Post. This includes checking the balance on your card, viewing transaction history and more. It does NOT remove funds from your account.
Email Registration
If you have not received your email confirmation, please check your spam folder.
Upon opening the application for the first time, you must register your email address and accept the terms and conditions. A confirmation email will be sent to you to approve the activation. 
Go ahead and add your first card. If you did not activate your email, you will be prompted again when you check the balance of your first card. This will allow you to enter your email address again and correct any mistakes.
Passcode Protection
If you forget your passcode, uninstall Zenwallet and then install it again. This will allow you to register again and enter a new passcode.
In addition to your phone's passcode, you can enable another passcode just for Zenwallet and if your phone has fingerprint login you can also turn that on for Zenwallet. If you have not opened the app for 5 minutes you will be asked to enter your passcode or fingerprint to access your cards. You can disable this with the menu at the top left. There is no need to sign out or log off. 
To change your passcode, turn off the passcode function using the top left menu, then enable the passcode again and you can enter a new passcode.

## Card Security
When you add a card to your Zenwallet, it is stored locally on your phone. There is no centralized database of card information.  This helps you keep your cards and data secure.  If you switch to a new phone, just register again and scan your cards to add them to the new phone.
